## Spring MVC Film CRUD

### Team Homework Project for Skill Distillery

### Summary
A movie database accessible to a user through a local web browser. Explores the concept of CRUD (Create Read Update Delete).
A user is presented with a menu to choose from. Options include searching the film database by id#, searching the film database by keyword targeting both the title and description, and the user can enter their own film into the database.
When a film is displayed all the details from the film table associated with that film are also displayed. In addition for the original films in the database the film's actors and category are also displayed. Film's added by the user show only the details from the film table.
When viewing a film the user is presented with the option to modify/update or delete the film. This feature works for user created films beyond the original database only, to avoid interference with connected or 'child' data tables.
Users always have the option to return to the main menu.

## Technology Used
 <ul> <li> Spring Tool Suite 4 <li> MAMP <li>JDBC <li>Git <li>Spring MVC <li>Gradle <li>html <li>xml <li>jsp <li>java <li>OO <li>MySql
 <li>Full Stack </li> </ul>

## Lessons Learned
The integration of Full Stack using Java and OO with DAO, a Controller, and html, jsp, xml, and servlet on the front end.
Also, this was a team project. Communication is key and we learned the idiosyncrasies of GitHub. Also, we practiced how to allow each teammate to participate effectively and fully without stepping on each other.

## Further Goals
Make the site attractive using CSS and/or BootStrap.
Better understanding of the push / pull practices of GitHub without causing merge problems.
